# Project Name: Lend and Borrow Items 

## Idea:
The website allows users to lend and borrow items from each other. Lenders can make extra cash by renting out items not frequently used at home. Borrowers, on the other hand, look for what they temporarily need.

## Inspiration:
Help people to get what they need it (temporarily) instead of buying it.
